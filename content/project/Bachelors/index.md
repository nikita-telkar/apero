### Using WNT5A Expression to Characterize Development in the Human Gut    

> The [WNT genes](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gb-2001-3-1-reviews3001) are known to participate in genetic pathways involved in cell patterning, signalling, and proliferation during development. WNT5A in particular is invloved in a number of [syndromes](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=WNT5A) which are caused by abnormal cell signalling or growth. The gut (made up of the esophagus, intestines, and anus) is one of the organs that grows and elongates the most during embryonic develpement.

**Using immunohistochemistry, I measured the presence of the WNT5A protein the human embryonic gut at [Carnegie Stage 20 (~50 days post conception)](https://embryology.med.unsw.edu.au/embryology/index.php/Carnegie_stage_20).**

> #### Project Highlights:  

- Received the UK-wide competitive [Genetics Society Summer Studentship Award](https://genetics.org.uk/grants/summer-studentships/) 2016.  
- Trained in MAPaint and Amira software on Linux, which involved transferring the wet-lab protein expression results into a computer-based 3D model.  
- Expression data and results of the project  uploaded to the NIH-funded HuDSeN database under the [Human Developmental Biology Resource (HDBR)](http://hdbratlas.org/organ-systems/gi-tract/gi-models.html).  
- [Attended the Genetics Society Summer Workshop](https://genetics.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/15027387_10211122879777688_5581119349267154163_n.jpg) to present my research and the report of the same was selected to be published in the [Genetics Society January 2017 Newsletter](https://genetics.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Issue-76-_-January-2017.pdf).  
- [Research poster](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jmUJNHydDgV3-tvmsTmlrqDHbtkCfDcq/view?usp=sharing
) won awards at two separate [University competitions](https://research.ncl.ac.uk/expeditionresearchscholarships/prizewinners/2016winners/).
