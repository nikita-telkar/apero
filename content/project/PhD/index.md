### Characterizing small non-coding RNAs in the human placenta  

> The human placenta is the indispensible organ necessary for all water, nutrient, gas, and waste exchange between the mother and fetus; as such gene expression is tightly regulated. Gene regulation is carried out a number of mechanisms, and gene repression by small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) is one of these processes. [Exclusive placentally-expressed sncRNA loci in the placenta have been identified](https://10.1016/j.ajog.2015.07.046), however, studies have routinely focused on only one species of sncRNA (microRNAs).

**My project aims at**:  

1. Characterizing the sncRNA species that are present in the human placenta  
2. Investigating novel sncRNA species  
3. Cataloguing the ones that differ in expression by different variables (like trimester of the pregnancy, sex of the fetus, ancestry, depression and anti-depressant status of the mother, and a few others).  

DNA methylation is another epigenetic regulatory mechanism, and [the placenta has been recognized for its unique epigenetic landscape](https://10.1101/cshperspect.a023044). The sncRNA expression data observed will be integrated with sample-matched DNAm data to investigate whether any correlation in expression exists between the two gene regulation mechansisms. [The placental gene expression profile also resembles that of cancer](https://10.1098/rsob.180081), and the top sncRNAs of interest will be examined for their connection to cancer progression.     

**Software**: Predominantly R. Some of my code is available on my [GitHub](https://github.com/nikita-telkar/Projects).

> #### Project Highlights  
- First instance of large-scale trancriptomic sequencing of the human placenta.  
- Establishment of the normative placental transcriptomic profile by several inherent biological variables, and extrinsic technical and environmental variables.   
- Self-taught RNAseq data analysis  
  - quality control, normalization, PCA, linear modelling, DNAm correlation, gene/pathway enrichment  
- Correlation to some cardiovasuclar and cancer pathway genes.  
- Pilot analysis showed that there indeed are microRNAs differentially-expressed by trimester.
