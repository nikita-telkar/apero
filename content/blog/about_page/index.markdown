**A 2nd year PhD Candidate in the [Medical Genetics Graduate Program](https://medgen.med.ubc.ca/) at [The University of British Columbia](https://ubc.ca), I currently reside in the lovely and vibrant city of Vancouver.**    

**My research interests lie in developmental, cardiovascular, and population genetics. My curiotsity is driven by wanting to *elucidate the genetic differences that exist between populations of different ancestries*.**    

**I'm an avid bibliophile, coffee enthusiast, occasional ukulele player, and Team Xbox.**
